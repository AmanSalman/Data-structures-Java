# Data Structures

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms from a course at Palestine Technical University - Kadoorie. The implementations include:

- **Lists**: Generic lists, linked lists built using stacks.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Basic operations and implementations.
- **Trees**: Binary trees and binary search trees.
- **Heaps**: Min-heaps and max-heaps.
- **Hashing**: Basic hashing techniques.
- **Specialized Structures**: Doubly linked lists, circular queues, and stack-based arrays.
- **Sorting**: Common sorting algorithms.
